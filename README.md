# **A Toolkit for Omics Genetic Analysis**<br>

OmiGA (Omics Genetic Analysis) is a toolkit designed to ultra-efficient genetic analysis for high-throughput measurements of omics, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation, metabolites, Microbiome, protein abundance, and so forth. Additionally, OmiGA is applicable to genome-wide association analysis for complex traits. **For detailed documentation, please click [**here**](https://omiga.bio).**

OmiGA currently supports the following analyses:

**Molecular Quantitative Trait Locus (molQTL) mapping**
- Cis-QTL, independent cis-QTL, interaction cis-QTL, trans-QTL
- Linear mixed model and linear model
- Additive and/or non-additive effects
- Calculating genetic relationship matrix
- Automatically choosing covariates using PCA analysis for genotype and phenotype data

**Heritability analysis of molecular traits**
- Partitioning additive and/or non-additive heritability
- Estimating the cis-, trans-heritability, and global heritability
