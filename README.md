## Introduction <br>
OmiGA (Omics Genetics Analysis) is a toolkit designed to ultra-efficient genetic analysis for high-throughput measurements of omics, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation, metabolites, Microbiome, protein abundance, and so forth. Additionally, OmiGA is applicable to genome-wide association analysis for complex traits.
